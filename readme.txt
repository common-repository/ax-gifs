A plugin which allows you to embed accessible gifs from GIPHY into the content editor with custom alt tags.


== Description ==
PLEASE NOTE: This plugin is for the classic WYSIWYG (normal text window) editor, and does not currently work with Gutenberg. This functionality is coming soon.

Accessibility shouldn\'t be an optional extra, and even better than accessibility is inclusion. At the Big Hack we\'re pushing for a digital future where everyone can use the internet, regardless of ability.

That\'s why we\'ve created an accessible GIPHY lookup that can embed gifs in an accessible way, both on the back-end and with markup, and on the front end. This is only the first step, and we\'ll be adding to this plugin, and creating more, in the near future.

If you have any feedback / you have an idea you think could make the internet more accessible, please email harry@clearhonestdesign.com
